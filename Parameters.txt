Funksjoner:
PlayerLevel = max(0.1, min(1.1, TotalLivesLeft/StartingLives + 0.05*APS + 0.2*Variety ))
  Variety = [0,1]. n/TotalNumberofDifferentTowerTypesIncludingUpgrades, where n = player's number of different tower types.
  APS = Actions Per Second = Actions/Second. [0,inf>, but usually [0,5].
Metric = RandDouble(1,(GoodDifficulty)) + RandDouble(1,(Happy)) + RandDouble(-0.5,0.5) * gameLengthMultiplier
  gameLengthMultiplier increases by 0.02 every game.
  GoodDifficulty is integer number of thumbs, 1,2 or 3, chosen by user.
  Happy is integer number of thumbs, 1, 2 or 3, chosen by user.

- ChanceForDiggers = (SumHappyOn/(3*NumberOfGames))/(SumHappyOff/(3*NumberOfGames)
  + SumHappyOn/(3*NumberOfGames))
  SumHappyOn = Total gathered happiness when Diggers are switched on
  = SumHappyOn + RandInt(1,(Happy))
  SumHappyOff = Total gathered happiness when Diggers are switched off
  = SumHappyOff + RandInt(1,(Happy))
- ChanceForSuperMobs = (SumHappyOn/(3*NumberOfGames))/(SumHappyOff/(3*NumberOfGames)
  + SumHappyOn/(3*NumberOfGames))
  SumHappyOn = Total gathered happiness when Super Mobs are switched on
  = SumHappyOn + RandInt(1,(Happy))
  SumHappyOff = Total gathered happiness when Super Mobs are switched off
  = SumHappyOff + RandInt(1,(Happy))
- ChanceForEarthquakes = (SumHappyOn/(3*NumberOfGames))/(SumHappyOff/(3*NumberOfGames)
  + SumHappyOn/(3*NumberOfGames))
  SumHappyOn = Total gathered happiness when Earthquakes are switched on
