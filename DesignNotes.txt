Other things:
Towers - Give access to different types of towers based on what user places?
Enemies - Attempt to send mostly fun enemies, e.g. if a user hates stealthed creeps, don't send.
Graphics - Different levels of "bling" such as effects when lasers shoot, exploding enemies, etc.
Map - Depending on style, fixed path generate maps to the users preference.
