Abstract
Minske bilder i Example, Questionnaire

In the
Algorithm chapter we go through in detail how the game jumps to change its content
and difficulty.

The "Probability for a digger enemy to appear" parameter is simply the
probability that each of these 45 enemies is a digger. So a value of 0.67 out of 1, should
result in approximately 30 diggers, which is really a challenge. In the Discussion
chapter we discuss some weaknesses of this approach.

In Discussion we
discuss the earthquake functionality, as we received some mixed feedback on it.

However, in Future
Work we present some possibilities for further development and use for AdaptiveTD.
