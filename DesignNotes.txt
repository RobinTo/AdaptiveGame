In the
Algorithm chapter we go through in detail how the game jumps to change its content
and difficulty.

The "Probability for a digger enemy to appear" parameter is simply the
probability that each of these 45 enemies is a digger. So a value of 0.67 out of 1, should
result in approximately 30 diggers, which is really a challenge. In the Discussion
chapter we discuss some weaknesses of this approach.

In Discussion we
discuss the earthquake functionality, as we received some mixed feedback on it.

However, in Future
Work we present some possibilities for further development and use for AdaptiveTD.


Relations make our game balanced, but slow search
Since Digger, which is not in relation, this seems to be the case.

The algorithm will not necessarily converge, if in a bad position, thus the algorithm will jump.
This is positive, but lets average not reach maximum.

Generell trend er oppover, men går treigere etter hvert, og jo flere du vil ha oppover. Derfor vil v ha specialized guided.
