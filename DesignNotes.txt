Code cleanup

- Have tower targeting algorithm test for enemeis in a SortedList with distance travelled as sort parameter.
This way just test from one until one is inside range, instead of testing for all which one is closer.


Stylistic choices:
Plants vs zombies style
Fixed path, e.g. bloons tower defense
Walk anywhere, takes shortest path around towers

Modifiable Tower Stats:
Damage
Possibly health? E.g. certain creeps will shoot back

Modifiable Enemy Stats:
Health
Velocity
Armor
? AoEarmor
? Single Target Armor

Other things:
Towers - Give access to different types of towers based on what user places?
Enemies - Attempt to send mostly fun enemies, e.g. if a user hates stealthed creeps, don't send.
Graphics - Different levels of "bling" such as effects when lasers shoot, exploding enemies, etc.
Map - Depending on style, fixed path generate maps to the users preference.
