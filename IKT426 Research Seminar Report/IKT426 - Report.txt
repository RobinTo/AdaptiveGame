This report will discuss the paper "Difficulty Scaling of Game AI", by Pieter Spronck, Ida Sprinkhuizen-Kuyper and Eric Postma, 2004. Artificial intelligence will henceforth be abbreviated AI. This problem is a hard problem to solve, as game AI usually cannot be approached the same way as regular AI, trying to make them as smart as possible, but has to make mistakes for the player to beat them.

The problem discussed in the paper by Spronck et al. is how you can adapt the difficulty of a game AI in real time. The difficulty in this case is how hard it would be for a player to win at the game. The main in this field is scaling the difficulty of the AI to produce what is referred to in the paper as "even games", which means that the player should not win 100% of the time, or if he does, for instance if the game requires it e.g. roguelikes@("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike") with premanent death, it should not be easy for the player to win 100% of the time.

This paper will discuss Difficulty Scaling of Game AI @("http://www.dcc.ru.nl/~idak/publications/papers/SpronckGAMEON2004.pdf"), we have also read and may take elements from @("Rewrite to proper style, ONLINE ADAPTATION OF GAME OPPONENT AI WITH DYNAMIC SCRIPTING, published in the International Journal of Intelligent Games and Simulation, page 45-53, by Pieter Sprock et al.") which is the paper where they explain the method they use in the main paper.

# The Paper - Difficulty Scaling of Game AI

## Paper Abstract
The abstract of the paper is as follows:
"'Difficulty scaling' is the automatic adaptation of a game, to adapt the challenge a game poses to a human player. In general, a game of which the challenge level matches the skill of the human player (i.e., an “even game”) is experienced as more entertaining than a game that is either too easy or too hard. In practice, when difficulty scaling is implemented in a game, it only adapts a few parameters. Even state-of-the-art games do not apply it to game AI, i.e., to the behaviour of computer-controlled opponents in a game. In prior work, we designed a novel online-learning technique called “dynamic scripting”, that is able to automatically optimise game AI during game-play. In the present paper, we research to what extent dynamic scripting can be used to adapt game AI in order to elicit an even game. We investigate three difficulty-scaling enhancements to the dynamic scripting technique, namely high-fitness penalising, weight clipping, and top culling. Experimental results indicate that top culling is particularly successful in creating an even game. We conclude that dynamic scripting, using top culling, can enhance the entertainment value of games by scaling the difficulty level of the game AI to the playing skill of the human player." NEED REF

Firstly, the abstract defines what difficulty scaling is, and its purpose. Since many computer games use computer-controlled opponents to challenge the player, the purpose of difficulty scaling is to make these challenges as even as possible, as this is often viewed as "more entertaining". Secondly, the abstract claims that state-of-the-art difficulty scaling is not applied to the behavior of game AI but rather to more simple parameters. In order to change this, the group has previously "designed a novel online-learning technique called 'dynamic scripting'". This technique is described in their prior paper, mentioned in the introduction. (REF!) Thirdly, the abstract explains three "difficulty-scaling enhancements", which is added to dynamic scripting, in order to make even games. Lastly, the abstract concludes that the technique called 'top culling' is the best for using dynamic scripting to create even games.

## Paper Structure
The structure of the paper is resembling the structure of the abstract, starting out with an introduction, motivating the need for difficulty scaling, as well giving some background on dynamic scripting. Then, the paper starts explaining difficulty scaling and the three techniques used to enhance dynamic scripting, namely high-fitness penalising, weight clipping and top culling. After the theory is given, a few experiments are shown, before the discussion and conclusion states that top culling is the better of the three techniques.

## Dynamic Scripting

The game AIs used to test techniques in the paper are all created using a process created by the authors in earlier work called Dynamic Scripting @("Rewrite to proper style, ONLINE ADAPTATION OF GAME OPPONENT AI WITH DYNAMIC SCRIPTING, published in the International Journal of Intelligent Games and Simulation, page 45-53, by Pieter Sprock et al."). As the figure shows this process uses a rulebase with different rules as to how the game could be played. When the computer generates a script, which describes how the AI should play, it selects rules based on a weight value which is then modified based on the outcome of the game, if the AI wins the weight is increased and if the AI loses it is decreased.

The problem discussed in the paper we discuss here is how to limit the AIs abilities to produce even games, which will be discussed in the following sub-chapters.

## Difficulty Scaling


## Paper Experiments and Discussion

The paper tested the different techniques in a series of experiments using two CRPG computer games. These games are based around combat between two teams, which may have different classes which can perform different abilities. Experiments were conducted in a created variation of Baldur's Gate and in the commercial game Neverwinter Nights.

These experiments ran simulations playing one team using the dynamic scripting method with techniques mentioned above against a static AI team. The goal was to find which technique would be able to achieve closest to 50% win rate against all tactics.

These experiments show that top culling was the best result, as it was the only technique to consistently produce even games against all the static tactics. 

## Paper Conclusion and Future Work

The paper concludes that of the techniques tested top culling worked the best, and high fitness penalizing worked the worst. However they state that with a different fitness function, high fitness penalizing might work better.

For future work the authors state that they want to experiment with offline learning techniques and see whether any can be used to design completely new rules for the Dynamic Scripting rulebase during gameplay, and the entertainment value for humans playing against AIs using Dynamic Scripting. @("http://www.dcc.ru.nl/~idak/publications/papers/SpronckGAMEON2004.pdf")
