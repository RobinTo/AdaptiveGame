<p>
This report will discuss the paper "Difficulty Scaling of Game AI", by Pieter Spronck, Ida Sprinkhuizen-Kuyper and Eric Postma, 2004. Artificial intelligence will henceforth be abbreviated AI. This problem is a hard problem to solve, as game AI usually cannot be approached the same way as regular AI, trying to make them as smart as possible, but has to make mistakes for the player to beat them.
</p>

<p>
The problem discussed in the paper by Spronck et al. is how you can adapt the difficulty of a game AI in real time. The difficulty in this case is how hard it would be for a player to win at the game. The main in this field is scaling the difficulty of the AI to produce what is referred to in the paper as "even games", which means that the player should not win 100% of the time, or if he does, for instance if the game requires it e.g. roguelikes<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">[1]</a> with premanent death, it should not be easy for the player to win 100% of the time.
</p>

<p>
This paper will discuss Difficulty Scaling of Game AI <a href="http://www.dcc.ru.nl/~idak/publications/papers/SpronckGAMEON2004.pdf">[2]</a>, we have also read and may take elements from <a href='#reference_3' title='Rewrite to proper style, ONLINE ADAPTATION OF GAME OPPONENT AI WITH DYNAMIC SCRIPTING, published in the International Journal of Intelligent Games and Simulation, page 45-53, by Pieter Sprock et al.'>[3]</a> which is the paper where they explain the method they use in the main paper.

<h1 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai'>The Paper - Difficulty Scaling of Game AI</h1>

<p>
We will go through the paper mostly one headline at a time. First, we present the paper abstract, as it outlines the background and problems very well, and the rest of the article follows its structure.
</p>

<h2 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai_-_paper_abstract'>Paper Abstract</h2>
<p>
The abstract of the paper is as follows:<br>
"'Difficulty scaling' is the automatic adaptation of a game, to adapt the challenge a game poses to a human player. In general, a game of which the challenge level matches the skill of the human player (i.e., an “even game”) is experienced as more entertaining than a game that is either too easy or too hard. In practice, when difficulty scaling is implemented in a game, it only adapts a few parameters. Even state-of-the-art games do not apply it to game AI, i.e., to the behaviour of computer-controlled opponents in a game. In prior work, we designed a novel online-learning technique called “dynamic scripting”, that is able to automatically optimise game AI during game-play. In the present paper, we research to what extent dynamic scripting can be used to adapt game AI in order to elicit an even game. We investigate three difficulty-scaling enhancements to the dynamic scripting technique, namely high-fitness penalising, weight clipping, and top culling. Experimental results indicate that top culling is particularly successful in creating an even game. We conclude that dynamic scripting, using top culling, can enhance the entertainment value of games by scaling the difficulty level of the game AI to the playing skill of the human player." NEED REF
</p>

<p>
Firstly, the abstract defines what difficulty scaling is, and its purpose. Since many computer games use computer-controlled opponents to challenge the player, the purpose of difficulty scaling is to make these challenges as even as possible, as this is often viewed as "more entertaining". Secondly, the abstract claims that state-of-the-art difficulty scaling is not applied to the behavior of game AI but rather to more simple parameters. In order to change this, the group has previously "designed a novel online-learning technique called 'dynamic scripting'". This technique is described in their prior paper, mentioned in the introduction. (REF!) Thirdly, the abstract explains three "difficulty-scaling enhancements", which is added to dynamic scripting, in order to make even games. Lastly, the abstract concludes that the technique called 'top culling' is the best for using dynamic scripting to create even games.
</p>

<h2 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai_-_paper_structure'>Paper Structure</h2>
<p>
The structure of the paper is resembling the structure of the abstract, starting out with an introduction, motivating the need for difficulty scaling, as well giving some background on dynamic scripting. Then, the paper starts explaining difficulty scaling and the three techniques used to enhance dynamic scripting, namely high-fitness penalising, weight clipping and top culling. After the theory is given, a few experiments are shown, before the discussion and conclusion states that top culling is the better of the three techniques.
</p>

<h2 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai_-_dynamic_scripting'>Dynamic Scripting</h2>

<h2 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai_-_difficulty_scaling'>Difficulty Scaling</h2>
<p>
This section starts out by first describing how many games deal with players on different levels, that is by setting different, discrete difficulty settings, such as 'easy, normal and hard'. These settings usually does not affect the behavior of the game AI, only their relative strength to the player, maybe even in an unfair or cheating way. This paper presents how the difficulty level can adapt to the player as the game is played, not only by changing relative strength numbers, but also by allowing the game AI to change tactics.
</p>

<h2 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai_-_techniques'>Techniques</h2>

<p>
Based on dynamic scripting, the paper presents three different enhancement techniques, which will make the game AI adapt its level more closely to the human player.
</p>

<h3 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai_-_techniques_-_high-fitness_penalising'>High-Fitness Penalising</h3>
<p>
The first technique is high-fitness penalising, which gives more rewards to mediocre fitness values, instead of optimal ones, using the following formula, "where F is replaced by F′ defined as follows:" (REF)
</p>
<div id='high-fitness_penalising' class='figure'><img src='high-fitness_penalising.png' alt='High-fitness penalising formula) (REF' title='High-fitness penalising formula) (REF'><div class='caption'>High-fitness penalising formula) (REF</div></div>
<p>
"where F is the calculated fitness value and p is the reward-peak value, i.e., the fitness value that should get the highest reward. The higher p is set, the more effective opponent behaviour will be." (REF) Also, the value of p is adjusted by a small amount after each fight with a player, based on whether the fight was lost (up) or won (down).
</p>

<h3 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai_-_techniques_-_weight_clipping'>Weight Clipping</h3>
<p>
There is a value called W_max, that limits the maximum level of optimisation for a tactic. By changing this value to a higher number, better tactics can be developed, and vice versa. Weight clipping changes this value automatically, so that when the computer beats the player, W_max is lowered, and when the player wins, it is elevated.
</p>
<div id='wc_and_tc' class='figure'><img src='WCandTC.png' alt='Weight Clipping and Top Culling process and parameters' title='Weight Clipping and Top Culling process and parameters'><div class='caption'>Weight Clipping and Top Culling process and parameters</div></div>
<p>
 (REF) Where W_inc and W_dec is how much W_max is elevated or lowered, W_init is the starting value for W_max and W_min is the minimum value for W_max. The arrow 'a' shows a rule with too low weight value, and arrow 'b' shows a rule with too high weight value. Both will be increased/decreased to the minimum/maximum levels.
</p>

<h3 id='the_paper_-_difficulty_scaling_of_game_ai_-_techniques_-_top_culling'>Top Culling</h3>
<p>
Top culling is simlar to weight clipping, but instead of decreasing values for rules with too high weight values, it allows them to grow beyond W_max, but the game AI will not be able to select them. If W_max later changes to a higher level, they may be selected again.
